# Implementing-the-Perceptron-algorithm-for-finding-the-weights-of-a-Linear-Discriminant-function
the objective of this experiment is to apply perceptron algorithm to find the weights of a linear discriminant function. Perceptron algorithm is an incremental way for finding the weights of a linear discriminant function. In this experiment we will apply this algorithm to find weights of a given linear discriminant function. In this algorithm we start with a random weights and gradually we will forward to the actual weights. Though this algorithm has some drawbacks we will apply it for its simplicity. There are two implementation of this algorithm: one is batch processing (also known as many at a time), and the other is one at a time. We will evaluate our sample data with both process and in the result analysis section we will compare the performance of this two methods with different learning rate.
